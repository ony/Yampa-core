[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=ivanperez-keera&url=https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa&title=Yampa&language=&tags=github&category=software)

Domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming hybrid (mixed
discrete-time and continuous-time) systems. Yampa is based on the concepts of
Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and is structured using arrow
combinators.

This is a new version of Yampa. Although the old API is mainly respected, the
code has been reorganised to facilitate understanding and documentation. The
API is not fully backwards compatible, but most projects should work without
changes or with minimal adaptations. If that is not the case, please let us
know. Also, if you are FRP savvy, please take a look around and tell us whether
there's anything you'd change. The documentation is available at:
http://ivanperez-keera.github.io/haddock/Yampa/FRP-Yampa.html

# Installation

Yampa is available on hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa.

```
$ cabal sandbox init         # Optional, but recommended
$ cabal update
$ cabal install Yampa
```

# Examples

There are many programs written in Yampa. See the following examples:

* Haskanoid: a game that uses SDL multimedia, wiimote and kinect.
  https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskanoid
* Space invaders: a demonstration game used for a paper.
  https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SpaceInvaders
* Frag: a 3D first person shooting game.
  https://hackage.haskell.org/package/frag

A more comprehensive list can be obtained using the reverse dependency finder
(http://packdeps.haskellers.com/reverse/Yampa), but only programs uploaded to
hackage are listed.

# Backends

Yampa is backend agnostic, you can ultimately connect it to any backend you
want. Existing backends include:
* SDL
* OpenGL / GLUT
* WX (see wxHaskell)

# Use in production

* Keera Studios is using it for several Haskell games for Android
  including a game currently available on Google Play. See:
  * http://facebook.com/keerastudios
  * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.keera.games.magiccookies

# Documentation and tutorials

The distribution of Yampa comes with subtantial haddock documentation, which you can
build using haddock or just [read online](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa).
To build a local copy, do:

```
$ cabal unpack Yampa ## Or git clone this-repo
$ cd Yampa-*
$ cabal init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal configure && cabal haddock --internal
```

Documentation is also available online: https://wiki.haskell.org/Yampa

# Papers and technical reports

For a list of Yampa-related papers, see:

See also PhD technical report, chapter 3. http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~ixp/
which includes a review of FRP and outlines some existing issues.

# Help and collaboration

You can collaborate at least in three ways:

* File an issue (https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa/issues).
* Write documentation (send a link and/or a pull request).
* Research: we are constantly trying to improve Yampa. We'd be glad to have
  collaborators.  If you are working on this, please, let us know.

  keep working on this for quite some time._ -- Ivan Perez)
